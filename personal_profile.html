        <h2> 16 Personality Test</h2>
        <h3> The Defender: 
        "The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the 
        definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent 
        analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and 
        robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type. 
        Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things,
        people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts,
        and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are." (16Personalities, 2011).

        <h2> Online Learning Style Test</h2>
        <h3> Auditory Learner:
        "If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand 
        and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, 
        and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. 
        You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order 
        to know it. As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if 
        you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though 
        you may be hearing and understanding everything being said." (Education Planner, 2011).

        <h2> Which Fruit Are you? </h2>
        <h3>  Mango is the life of the party. Mango is never dull. Its what you have on holiday, or 
        in a fun cocktail or dessert. No one has ever been sad or disappointed to see a 
        mango.

        <h2> Notes on results </h2>
        <h3>  I was very intrigued to receive my learning style results. For the longest time I had 
        thought I was more of a visual learner. However, now I will try and voice concepts
        and new ideas out loud to gain a better understanding of them. For my 16 
        personality test, I believe it to be very accurate. Although I am quite conservative 
        in social settings, I still do not have issues talking to other people. Furthermore, I 
        believe change and new ideas are always welcomed and encouraged as new 
        approaches and perspectives must be adopted to keep up with the rapid 
        changing world. In terms of what fruit I am , I was hoping for a banana. 
        <br> <br>
        These results will make me more wary when participating in group activity. For 
        example, my 16 personality test that I may be quite shy. Therefore, I need to be
        proactive and communicate when I am in a group setting. Furthermore, as I 
        receptive to change and new ideas I believe this will be beneficial in group 
        settings as many group members will be pitching in their unique perspectives. 
        Lastly, understanding that I am a visual learner, I will be making sure that I am 
        paying full attention when we are discussing as a group to maximise my 
        understanding of the topic.
