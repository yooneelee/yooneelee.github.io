            My name is Yoonee Lee. Pronounced like 'uni' in university. My background is 
            South Korean. However, since I was born and raised in Melbourne my Korean 
            has a slight Australian accent. I am currently in my second year as I have just
            transferred from RMIT - Computer Science. <br><br>
            Some interesting facts about me include being a brown belt in judo, hit diamond in league of legends and works at Uniqlo!Some interesting facts about me include being a brown belt in judo, hit diamond in league of legends and works at Uniqlo!
