        <h2> What is your interest in IT?</h2>
        <h3> From here my passion for technology only went up and I decided to pursue a career in this field. 
             Initially I began to try programming, learning languages such as Java, Python and C++. Although it was interesting and fun at times,
             I soon discovered programming was not for me. Then, I was introduced to the world of Cybersecurity. This field has everything I was interested in. 
             It allows me to delve in deeper to the ethical and social aspects of technology usage. Furthermore, I can research and analyse the risks involved in technology. Lastly, it also includes great technical skills such as Linux, Bash, & terminal administration, penetration testing and network packet analysing. 
             Who knows what the future holds, but I am currently very motivated to continue the path I am on.

        <h2> Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
        <h3> RMIT was a university I had in my mind when choosing where to obtain a 
             Bachelor's degree in I.T.  A few of my friends had attended RMIT and had great 
             things to say about the city campus' facilities and overall university. In addition, 
             RMIT is top 150 in the world for their Computer Science and Information 
             Systems department. Therefore, it was very ideal to study Information Tech at 
             RMIT.

        <h2> What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
        <h3> During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn core ethical and professional 
            computer practices which will benefit me in my career as a I transition to full time
            work. Furthermore, I wish to learn and develop technical skills in my areas of study.
            For example; programming, security testing and cloud computing. Lastly, I expect 
            to learn soft skills such as; to be diligent, motivated and organised, which I can 
            translate into my everyday life.
