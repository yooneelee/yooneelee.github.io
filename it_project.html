        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <h3> My project idea is eHUB;  a website & APP that focuses on e-sport news and culture. 
        Similar to sport apps such as Bleacher Report and ESPN,   eHUB will include live 
        news around the league and scores from your favourite team. In addition, to add 
        to the cultural aspect, it will also feature trending twitch clips and channels in 
        all relevant e-sport categories. eHUB will also feature original content such as 
        podcasts, gaming tutorials, reviews and other entertainment content. eHUB aims 
        to bridge the gap between e-sport and the rest of the world, by delivering trust-
        worthy and entertaining content.  

        </h3>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <h3> The e-sport industry is a marketed that is waiting to tapped to it's full potential
        E-sport traces back to 1972 when the first Space Invaders Championship was held.
        Fast forward to 2020, and e-sport has become a 1 billion dollar industry that is 
        growing every year.   According to Statista the total viewership of e-sport is 297 
        million frequent viewers with 347 million occasional viewers. With the increasing
        rise of streaming platforms such as Twitch, YouTube and Facebook gaming the 
        total viewership is expected to rise to 646 million by 2023 (Activate Technology
        Media Outlook, 2021). There is an obvious market and demand for e-sports, and
        adopting a model similar to Bleacher Report, which thrived in the sports industry, 
        may prove to be successful.

        <h2> Tools and Technology</h2>
        <h3>  Firstly, Adobe XD should be used to create the overall design of the website and the 
        app. Other design tools may be necessary  such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to 
        create custom images. Secondly, This project will also require extensive programming.
        The website can be developed using web programming software and programming 
        languages such as Django, Python, HTML and CSS. Other options include using Java, 
        C++ , Flutter and Ruby. Looking at other popular websites and apps the most popular 
        tools are Python, Java and Javascript. A reliable code editor must be used in order to 
        write the code. Some options include Visual Studio Code, Intelli J and Android Studio. 
        Due to VSC's flexible nature to program both APPs and websites, using VSC is a strong 
        option. Moreover, database management software such as SQL is also required to 
        keep track of user login credentials. Lastly and importantly, powerful OS systems such 
        as Windows and Mac are required.
